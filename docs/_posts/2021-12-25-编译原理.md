# Intro to Compilers

[关于编译器和解释器](https://blog.csdn.net/qq_36627886/article/details/80402959)

- Fortrans : the first compiler
- Led to an enormous body of theoretical
- Mordern compilers preserve the outline of FORTRAN I

### Compilers Structure

1. Lexical Analysis
2. Parsing 
3. Semantic Analysis
4. Optimization
5. Code Generation

Lexical analysis divideds program text into "words" or "tokens"

An implement must do two things:
1. Recognize substrings corresponding to tokens (The lexemes)
2. Identify the token class of each lexeme

###  Finite Automata

> Transition  In state S1 on input a go to state S2
> If end of input and in accepting state => accept
> Otherwise =>terminates in not accepting state or get stuck => reject

Langage of a FA = set of accept states

DFA: Deterministic Finite Automata
    
NFA: Nondeterministic Finite Automata
