## Source roots
Source roots (or source folders)By assigning a folder to this category, you tell IntelliJ IDEA that this folder and its subfolders contain source code that should be compiled as part of the build process.

## Test source roots
These roots are similar to source roots but are for code intended for testing.Te
st source folders let you keep the code related to testing separate from the pro
duction code.

## Resource roots
Resource roots are for resource files used in your application.During the build process,all the contents of the resource folders are copied to the output folder as is.
