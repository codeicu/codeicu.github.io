# Test Driven Development
hard to test software
write test first
# manual test
- not repeatable
- not structured
- not standardised reporting
# unit testing
- a method/a database query/stored proc/a dynamic web page
- automated,self-validating,consistent/repeatable,independent,readable,fast
# AAA Arrange Act Assert : Given When Then
```
void testConnotOverDraw(){
  //Arrange
  BankAccount ac = new BankAccount(5000);
  //Act
  Ac.withdraw(3000);
  //Assert
  Assertequals(2000,ac.get_balance());
}
```
# Unit Testing with JUnit
one-off setup/teardown
assertThat()
# Hamcrest matchers
- more expressive
- clearer
- no need for optional String message
```
is(),equalTo()
not()
instanceOf()
nullValue(),notNullValue()
sameInstance()
lessThanOrEqualTo()
allOf(),anyOf()
endsWith()
closeTo()
hasItem()
```
# Define a Custom Macher
todO:
# grouping tests together
@RunWith(value=Suite.class)
# Test with Mock
```
NumberGenerator mocGenerator = createMock(NumberGenerator.class);
for(int i=1;i<7;i++){
  expect(mocGenerator.generate(anyInt)).andReturn(i);
}
replay(mockGenerate);
Lottery lotto = new Lottery(mockGenerate);
Set<Integer> numbers = lotto.generateRandomSet();
assertThat(lotto.formatNumbers(numbers),is("1-2-3-4-5-6"))
verify(mockGenerate);
```
# EasyMock: Introduction
- Create required mock objects,e.g. via createMock()
- Create an instance of the CUT,replacing dependencies on real collaborators with mocks
- set expections on mock(s)
- call replay(),which indicates expectation-setting has finished
- invoke a method on CUT, to verify if the mock get the calls we expected
- Optionally, make assertions(as before)

Note:
To use EasyMock, you must ensure easymock.jar is on the classpath, and that you import the org.easymock.EasyMock class. The EasyMock class contains a whole bunch of important static methods, e.g. createMock(), expect(), replay(), and verify()

# There are several ways to create a mock object in EasyMock
- createStrickMock(): 1. no unexpected method calls 2. the order of the calls must be as per expectations.
- createMock: 1. no unexpected calls  2.
- createNiceMock:
## EasyMock: Setting expections
- for a void method, use expectLastCall()
- if you want to specify the cardinality, use: times(int count)
## EasyMock: Replay and verify
- replay(mockRequest,mockResponse ) this indicates you've finished setting expections,and are ready to check if the expected method invocations  are actually made
- verify: this verifies that the tested object did perform all the method calls that were expected of it.
# Variations(变种)
- Classes can be mocked : add cglib-nodep and objenesis jars to the classpath
- make your test class extend EasyMockSupport : replayAll() verifyAll()
