A garbage collection root is an object that is accessible from outside the heap.

Memory Analyzer categorizes garbage collection roots according to the following list:

- Class loaded by system ClassLoader
    - static field in JDK classes(java.* etc)
- Live thread
    - stack -local vars, method params
    - java.lang.Thread instance
    - Object held as synchronization monitor
- JNI references
- JVM specials...
