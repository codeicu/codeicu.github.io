- The Mac’s Control key is primarily for helping you “right-click” things.
- Windows Ctrl key is the ⌘ key. Most Windows Ctrl-key combos correspond perfectly to ⌘-key sequences on the Mac.
- In many situations, keyboard shortcuts that involve the Alt key in Windows use the Option key on the Mac.
- There is no Windows-logo key on the Macintosh. Just about any USB keyboard works on the Mac, even if the keyboard was originally designed to work with a PC. Depending on the manufacturer of the keyboard, the Windows-logo key may work just like the Mac’s ⌘ key.
